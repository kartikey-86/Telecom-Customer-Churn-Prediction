# 📊 Comprehensive EDA: Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of telecom customer churn data, providing deep insights into customer behavior patterns and actionable business recommendations for reducing churn.

### 🔍 Business Problem
Customer churn is a critical challenge in the telecommunications industry. With customer acquisition costs being 5-25x higher than retention costs, understanding and predicting churn patterns is essential for business sustainability and growth.

### 📈 Key Objectives
- **Understand** the factors contributing to customer churn
- **Identify** high-risk customer segments and behavior patterns  
- **Analyze** relationships between services, demographics, and churn
- **Provide** data-driven recommendations for retention strategies
- **Create** actionable insights for business decision-making
