# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## About The Project
The aim of this project is to analyze customer demographics, services, tenure, and other variables to predict whether a customer will churn or not. By using machine learning techniques, this project helps telecom companies identify customers likely to leave and take preventative measures to retain them.

## Built With
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn (or specify any other libraries/frameworks used)

## Getting Started


## Usage
The notebook analyzes customer data, performs exploratory data analysis, preprocesses data, trains machine learning models, and predicts customer churn. Modify the notebook to experiment with different models or datasets.
